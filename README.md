# Atea team onboarding

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind the United project came from the observation that many **companies struggle with effective onboarding** for new employees. This can result in a range of negative outcomes, including increased turnover rates, decreased productivity, and decreased employee morale. As a result, there is a need for a tool that can streamline the onboarding process and ensure that new employees feel welcomed, supported, and engaged from day one. The United project aims to address this need by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly onboarding platform that can be customized to meet the unique needs of any organization's department.


## What it does
The United project offers a customizable onboarding toolbox menu, allowing users to drag and drop section templates that suit the specific needs of each team. As new employees go through the onboarding process, our AI collects feedback data, which is then analyzed to suggest ways to improve and personalize the onboarding flow to be more human-friendly. This feature enables HR and other tool users to continuously improve the onboarding process and ensure new employees feel supported, engaged and welcomed from day one.


## How we built it
The United project was built using modern software development tools and technologies. We used a combination of programming languages such as _Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS_ to develop the application. 


## Challenges we ran into
To create a demo of how the page would look for a new employee, we first **conducted extensive research** to understand the needs of new employees during the onboarding process. We then **designed and developed user interface prototypes** using design tools such as Canva and Google Sites.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our team's ability to collaborate and leverage modern software development tools and technologies to deliver a high-quality solution that meets the needs of our users.


## What we learned
During the development, we learned that effective onboarding requires a comprehensive and personalized approach that considers the unique needs of each department or team. We also discovered that collecting and analyzing feedback data can provide valuable insights to improve the onboarding process continuously.


## What's next for United
In the future, we plan to continue to develop and improve the United project by adding new features and functionalities based on user feedback. We aim to integrate more AI capabilities to provide personalized recommendations for onboarding new employees.
